Advent Calendar for Android
===========================

Show every day a new (advent) image.

This app allows you to define your own server url in the settings

* `__NAME__` - user name (in settings)
* `__URLDAY__` - only from 1st to 24th
* `__DAY__` - from 1st to end of month
* `__MONTH__` - month

The app uses this default url:
http://android.choas.net/advkalender/__NAME__/__URLDAY__.jpg

I've been using some images from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature ... yes, they aren't really 'advent-like' ;)

Hint: personal images are using a total different server and the default url ‘knows‘ only _unknown_ as user name.
